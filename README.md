# Conceptual 12M

We introduce the Conceptual 12M (CC12M), a dataset with ~12 million image-text pairs meant to be used for vision-and-language pre-training.
It is larger and covers a much more diverse set of visual concepts than [the Conceptual Captions](https://github.com/google-research-datasets/conceptual-captions) (CC3M), a dataset that is widely used for pre-training and end-to-end training of image captioning models.
Check our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.08981) for further details.

## FAQs

**Q1**: Can you provide image pixels?

**A1**: We do not own any of the images in the dataset and hence cannot legally provide them to you. The owner of an image can choose to delete it at anytime, in which case the image will no longer be available. Due to this, unfortunately, some images in the dataset will be lost over time, and we are unable to help with this issue.
###

**Q2**: Is it normal that a subset of images cannot be retrieved from the provided URLs?

**A2**: Yes. See Q1.
